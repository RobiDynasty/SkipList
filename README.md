This is an implementation of the "Skip List" data structure in Java. 

Ok there seems to be something wrong with my implementation of the SkipList. I need to make sure that each of the levels of the new node has a next value that it points to. 

Also, I need to ask about if keys of value 0 can exist. The SkipList that I have implemented so far does not do anything with key values of 0.
